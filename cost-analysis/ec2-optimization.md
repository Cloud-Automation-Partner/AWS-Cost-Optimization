# EC2 Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide provides strategies to optimize costs associated with EC2 instances.

## Strategies

### 1. Right-Sizing Instances
- **Use AWS Compute Optimizer**:
  - Navigate to the Compute Optimizer Dashboard.
  - Review the recommendations for EC2 instances.
  - Resize instances based on the recommendations.
- **Manual Right-Sizing**:
  - Analyze CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory utilization).
  - Identify underutilized instances.
  - Stop, resize, or terminate instances as needed.

### 2. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans
- **Evaluate Long-Term Usage**:
  - Use Cost Explorer to analyze historical usage patterns.
  - Estimate future usage.
- **Purchase Reserved Instances (RIs)**:
  - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
  - Click on `Reserved Instances` -> `Purchase Reserved Instances`.
  - Choose the instance type, region, and term (1-year or 3-year).
- **Purchase Savings Plans**:
  - Navigate to the Savings Plans Dashboard.
  - Choose the type of Savings Plan (Compute or EC2 Instance).
  - Select the plan that matches your usage patterns.

### 3. Spot Instances
- **Identify Suitable Workloads**:
  - Identify workloads that can tolerate interruptions (e.g., batch processing).
- **Launch Spot Instances**:
  - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
  - Click on `Spot Requests` -> `Request Spot Instances`.
  - Configure the Spot Instance request.
- **Use Spot Fleet**:
  - Create a Spot Fleet to manage multiple Spot Instances.
  - Configure the Spot Fleet request.

### 4. Elasticity and Auto Scaling
- **Set Up Auto Scaling Groups**:
  - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
  - Click on `Auto Scaling Groups` -> `Create Auto Scaling Group`.
  - Configure the Auto Scaling Group with appropriate policies.
- **Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**:
  - Distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
  - Configure health checks and scaling policies.

### 5. Monitor and Optimize Storage
- **Analyze EBS Usage**:
  - Identify unused or underutilized EBS volumes.
  - Snapshot and delete unused volumes.
- **Use Appropriate EBS Volume Types**:
  - Select volume types based on performance and cost needs (e.g., gp2 for general purpose, st1 for throughput optimized).

## Conclusion
Implementing these EC2 optimization strategies can lead to significant cost savings. Proceed to the [Lambda Optimization Guide](lambda-optimization.md) to optimize Lambda functions.
