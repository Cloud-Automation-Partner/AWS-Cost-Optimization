# Storage Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide provides strategies to optimize costs associated with S3 and EBS storage.

## Strategies

### S3 Optimization

1. **Use Storage Classes**:
   - **Standard-IA**: For infrequently accessed data.
   - **S3 Glacier**: For archival data.
   - **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatically moves data to the most cost-effective access tier.

2. **Implement Lifecycle Policies**:
   - Create lifecycle policies to transition objects to cheaper storage classes.
   - Example policy to transition to Standard-IA after 30 days and to Glacier after 90 days.

3. **Delete Unused Data**:
   - Identify and delete old or unused data.
   - Enable versioning and configure lifecycle policies to delete old versions.

4. **Optimize Data Transfer**:
   - Use Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.
   - Minimize cross-region data transfer.

### EBS Optimization

1. **Analyze Volume Usage**:
   - Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor EBS volume usage.
   - Identify underutilized volumes.

2. **Delete Unused Volumes**:
   - Identify and delete unattached or unused EBS volumes.
   - Take snapshots before deletion if necessary.

3. **Use Appropriate Volume Types**:
   - Select volume types based on performance and cost needs (e.g., General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS, Cold HDD).

4. **Snapshot Management**:
   - Regularly take snapshots of EBS volumes.
   - Delete old snapshots that are no longer needed.
